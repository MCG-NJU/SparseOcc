def checkpoint(function, *args, use_reentrant: bool = True, **kwargs):
    r"""Checkpoint a model or part of the model

    Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all
    intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing
    backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations,
    and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part
    of a model.

    Specifically, in the forward pass, :attr:`function` will run in
    :func:`torch.no_grad` manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate
    activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the
    :attr:`function` parameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and
    :attr:`function` is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on
    :attr:`function` again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then
    the gradients are calculated using these activation values.

    The output of :attr:`function` can contain non-Tensor values and gradient
    recording is only performed for the Tensor values. Note that if the output
    consists of nested structures (ex: custom objects, lists, dicts etc.)
    consisting of Tensors, these Tensors nested in custom structures will not
    be considered as part of autograd.


    .. warning::
        If :attr:`function` invocation during backward does anything different
        than the one during forward, e.g., due to some global variable, the
        checkpointed version won't be equivalent, and unfortunately it can't be
        detected.

    .. warning::
        If ``use_reentrant=True`` is specified, then if the checkpointed segment
        contains tensors detached from the computational graph by `detach()` or
        `torch.no_grad()`, the backward pass will raise an error. This is
        because `checkpoint` makes all the outputs require gradients which
        causes issues when a tensor is defined to have no gradient in the model.
        To circumvent this, detach the tensors outside of the `checkpoint`
        function. Note that the checkpointed segment can contain tensors
        detached from the computational graph if ``use_reentrant=False`` is
        specified.

    .. warning::
        If ``use_reentrant=True`` is specified, at least one of the inputs needs
        to have :code:`requires_grad=True` if grads are needed for model inputs,
        otherwise the checkpointed part of the model won't have gradients. At
        least one of the outputs needs to have :code:`requires_grad=True` as
        well. Note that this does not apply if ``use_reentrant=False`` is
        specified.

    .. warning::
        If ``use_reentrant=True`` is specified, checkpointing currently only
        supports :func:`torch.autograd.backward` and only if its `inputs`
        argument is not passed. :func:`torch.autograd.grad`
        is not supported. If ``use_reentrant=False`` is specified, checkpointing
        will work with :func:`torch.autograd.grad`.

    Args:
        function: describes what to run in the forward pass of the model or
            part of the model. It should also know how to handle the inputs
            passed as the tuple. For example, in LSTM, if user passes
            ``(activation, hidden)``, :attr:`function` should correctly use the
            first input as ``activation`` and the second input as ``hidden``
        preserve_rng_state(bool, optional):  Omit stashing and restoring
            the RNG state during each checkpoint.
            Default: ``True``
        use_reentrant(bool, optional): Use checkpointing
            implementation that requires re-entrant autograd.
            If ``use_reentrant=False`` is specified, ``checkpoint`` will use an
            implementation that does not require re-entrant autograd. This
            allows ``checkpoint`` to support additional functionality, such as
            working as expected with ``torch.autograd.grad`` and support for
            keyword arguments input into the checkpointed function. Note that future
